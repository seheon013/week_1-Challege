# week_1-Challege

This is my refactoring work of the given code.
I changed some simple <div class=""> and divide to header, article, and footer to make it semantic.
I made the elements to foolow a logical structure independent of styling and positioning as well.
Also, I added alt in every image code and added a concise, descriptive title.
